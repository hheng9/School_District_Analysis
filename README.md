# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of The School District Analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to collect the data, prepare the data, and analyze the data through multiple grade levels, students, school types, and scores. We filter the necessary data as requested by using tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda to pull the supplied CSV file information to gather the correct results as requested. Jupyter Notebook allows us to pull data from the Pandas library to clean, manipulate, and visualize all the data without altering the original dataset. Pandas lets us work with two different data types in the form of a series dataset or dataframe dataset.

### Collecting the Data
We began our analysis by importing Pasndas and the OS function by setting the read function to the supplied CSV path then verifying the data was imported correctly.

## Prepping the Data
After importing our file we needed to clean up the data to remove all unecessary information for better accesiblility. By doing so we needed to remove or drop missing values, NaN values, duplicate rows, unwanted suffix, and understanding or changing data types.
