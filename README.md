# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of The School District Analysis
### The purpose of this analysis was to collect the data, prepare the data, and analyze the data through multiple grade levels, students, school types, and scores. We filter the necessary data as requested by using tools such as Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Anaconda to pull the supplied CSV file information to gather the correct results as requested. Jupyter Notebook allows us to pull data from the Pandas library to clean, manipulate, and visualize all the data without altering the original dataset. Pandas lets us work with two different data types in the form of a series dataset or dataframe dataset.
